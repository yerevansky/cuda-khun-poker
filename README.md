# CFR Kuhn Poker Solver (CUDA)

This repository implements the **Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)** algorithm for the simplified poker game **Kuhn Poker** in **CUDA-parallelized** versions.

The algorithm converges to the **Nash equilibrium**, producing optimal mixed strategies for both players.

## 🎯 What is Kuhn Poker?

A classic minimal poker variant used in game theory:

| Rule             | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Deck             | `J`, `Q`, `K` (3 cards)         |
| Players          | 2                               |
| Cards per player | 1                               |
| Actions          | `c` – check, `b` – bet          |
| Game type        | Zero-sum, imperfect information |

Despite its simplicity, **bluffing is optimal**, making it ideal for CFR benchmarks.

**Theoretical payoffs:**

```
EV(Player 1) ≈ -0.055
EV(Player 2) ≈ +0.055
```

CUDA implementations converge to these values.

## ✅ Output Example

```
Elapsed time: 403.635 ms

Player 1 expected value: -0.0566698
Player 2 expected value: 0.0566698

Player 1 strategies:
Jrr      [0.79, 0.21]
Jrrcb    [1.00, 0.00]
Qrr      [1.00, 0.00]
Qrrcb    [0.45, 0.55]
Krr      [0.39, 0.61]
Krrcb    [0.00, 1.00]

Player 2 strategies:
Jrrc     [0.67, 0.33]
Jrrb     [1.00, 0.00]
Qrrc     [1.00, 0.00]
Qrrb     [0.66, 0.34]
Krrc     [0.00, 1.00]
Krrb     [0.00, 1.00]
```

✅ These match the known Nash equilibrium strategies.
